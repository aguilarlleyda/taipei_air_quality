# Time series forecasting of Taipei's air quality index
Air Quality Index (AQI) is a common indicator of pollutant concentration in the air. When measured repeatedly across time, AQI is bound to changes and fluctuations caused by many factors. In this project we tried to identify the different basic components affecting AQI, to capture them by fitting models to existing AQI data, and to rely on those models to predict future AQI. We used a dataset containing hourly AQI measurements from Taipei city spanning from 2016 to 2024. Rather than relying on an exhaustive approach where we tested a wide range of models, we based our modeling choices on what seemed plausible after data inspection. Following common practice, we took a look at three target components. First, trend, the most general, non-repeating change over time, which was best captured as a quadratic function where initial improving air quality eventually worsened. Second, seasonality, understood as multiple, overlapping and recurring oscillations in AQI. This component was modeled with a series of Fourier features that captured, in order of importance, annual, semiannual, monthly and daily AQI oscillationsThe third and last component was serial dependence, or the relationship between AQI measurements with their lags, which are those measurements made in the past. Upon discovering that such relationship was overwhelmingly linear, we fitted a series of linear regressions, with the best performance coming from the model with 8 lags as predictors. Since our forecast was made on a time period whose AQI values were already known, we could verify that our combined predictions accounted well for the original AQI data.
